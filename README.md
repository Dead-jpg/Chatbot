## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You need the following software installed on your computer:

* **Node.js & npm** (or **Yarn**): Download and install the latest stable version from [nodejs.org](https://js.org/).
* **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### 1. Installation ###

**A. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and clone the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Dead-jpg/Chatbot.git](https://github.com/Dead-jpg/Chatbot.git)
```

**B. Navigate to Project Directory**

```bash
cd Chatbot
```

**C. Install Dependencies**

Use the package manager of your choice to install the necessary packages:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR Using Yarn
yarn install

```

### 2. Starting the Development server ###

Run the run dev script. This command installs any missing packages and compiles your React code, then starts a local web server.

```bash
#Using npm
npm run dev

#OR Using Yarn
yarn run dev

```

### 3. Expected Result ###

The command will compile your project and, after a few seconds, it should automatically open your default web browser.

The chatbot will be running at the default development address, usually:

```bash

http://localhost:3000

```

If the browser doesn't open automatically, simply copy and paste the address above into your browser's address bar.
